/* CMSC 216, Spring 2021, Project #1
 * Public test 1 (public1.c)
 *
 * Tests calling prism_area(1, 1, 1).
 *
 * Note that this test also calls the other two functions but does not check
 * their results for correctness- it calls them only so you will be able to
 * tell that your other functions compile successfully on the submit server.
 * When you are writing your own tests, note that only the first assertion
 * below is actually doing anything (it is an example of how you should be
 * testing your functions yourself, as opposed to what follows it in this
 * test).
