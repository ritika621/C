/* CMSC 216, Spring 2021, Project #8
 * Public test 1 (public01.c)
 *
 * Tests executing one "compliation" command.  (In this test the compilation
 * command does not run the compiler- it's just a simple echo command that
 * prints something, which just tests the ability to execute one compilation
 * command.)
 *
 * This test will always unavoidably have memory leaks if you run it under
 * valgrind, so fix any other problems that valgrind identifies, but ignore
 * any memory leaks (or just add the --leak-check=no argument when running
 * this test with valgrind).
 *
 * (c) Larry Herman, 2021.  You are allowed to use this code yourself, but
 * not to provide it to anyone else.
